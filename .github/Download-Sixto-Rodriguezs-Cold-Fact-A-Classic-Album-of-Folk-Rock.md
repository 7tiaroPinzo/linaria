## Who is Sixto Rodriguez?
 
Sixto Rodriguez is a mysterious and enigmatic figure in the music world. He was born in 1942 in Detroit, Michigan, to Mexican immigrant parents. He started playing guitar at a young age and began performing in bars and clubs in the 1960s. He recorded two albums, Cold Fact (1970) and Coming from Reality (1971), but they were commercial failures in the US and he was dropped by his label. He then faded into obscurity and worked as a laborer, unaware of his fame overseas.
 
In South Africa and Australia, Cold Fact became a huge hit among the anti-apartheid and counterculture movements. His songs of protest, love, and despair resonated with the young generation who faced oppression and injustice. His fans believed that he had committed suicide on stage, but in fact he was alive and well in Detroit. In the 1990s, some South African fans tracked him down and brought him to their country, where he was greeted as a legend. He also toured Australia and Europe and gained recognition in the US after the documentary Searching for Sugar Man (2012) told his story.
 
## What is Cold Fact?
 
Cold Fact is the debut album of Sixto Rodriguez. It contains 12 tracks of folk rock with influences from blues, soul, psychedelia, and Latin music. The album was produced by Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore, who added funky arrangements and orchestration to Rodriguez's acoustic guitar and vocals. The album covers topics such as poverty, drugs, politics, religion, sex, and violence with a sharp wit and a poetic flair.
